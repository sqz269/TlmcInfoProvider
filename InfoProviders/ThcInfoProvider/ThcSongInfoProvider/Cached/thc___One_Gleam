 One Gleam
 Touhou slowcore / post-rock
 August 2016
 Usually I have some kind of EP or album or split to release for Comiket but this time I had just one song, which is fine too. Slowcore sounds exactly as you'd expect -- slow and moody -- and I wanted to see if I could evoke that sort of feeling in my music. As you can tell, I really like bright percussion instruments like celesta and glockenspiel.
